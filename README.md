# Manual Screen Editor

This program modifies rendered screens for Rain World. It functions as a basic paint application with a layer system for clear and concurrent camera data manipulation.
There are 10 different layers: 9 component layers and rendered preview (with a choice of in-file view or in-game view).

> Viewing level color while editing, depth, level color, light and sky.

See [Manual Screen Editor.pdf](/Manual%20Screen%20Editor.pdf) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> The Manual Screen Editor only supports Windows.
